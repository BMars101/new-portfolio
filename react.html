        Business Card Project
    </a>
    <p>This project was built as part of Scrimba's free React course. This is the first solo project in which we were given a figma design and asked to apply what we learned so far in the course. Up to this solo project we were learning about designing and organizing simple react components. The app is deployed on Netlify.</p>
